<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new study found a possible link between aluminum used in early childhood vaccines and the risk of children developing asthma before age 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the authors of the study caution that the results are not strong enough to suggest “questioning the safety of aluminum in vaccines.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, they call for additional research to better understand this risk. This might include studies using other large vaccine safety databases, and laboratory studies looking at children’s immune responses after vaccination.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/monica.gandhi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Monica Gandhi</a>, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who was not involved in the new research, said it is important to reassure parents about the safety of vaccines.</p>

<p>“There is absolutely no indication at this point [that we should] change our vaccine formulations or recommendations on routine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">childhood vaccinationsTrusted Source</a>,” she said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aluminum is used in many vaccines as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adjuvantTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;— which helps create a stronger immune response in people who receive a vaccine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Childhood vaccines that contain an aluminum adjuvant include: diptheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP); hepatitis B; Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB) vaccine; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines and seasonal flu vaccines do not use an aluminum adjuvant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previous research on the link between childhood vaccines and asthma has been mixed, the authors of the new study pointed out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One study found a small increased risk of asthma in children who received certain vaccines, while other studies found no increased risk or even a smaller risk of asthma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of these studies, though, looked specifically at exposure to aluminum in the vaccines, which the current study did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, rates of asthma among American children&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5608a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased in the 1980s and 1990sTrusted Source</a>, but have largely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6705e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained the sameTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;between 2001 and 2016, according to CDC data. So multiple factors are likely driving these trends.</p>
